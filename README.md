**Bankruptcy Prediction with Machine Learning**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. The Bankruptcy.ipynb notebook explores financial data, applies feature engineering, and builds predictive models to assess the likelihood of bankruptcy for companies.

**Features:**

- Dataset: The analysis is based on bankruptcy.xlsx, which contains financial indicators of companies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical analysis of financial ratios.
- Feature Engineering: Selection and transformation of key financial metrics.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementing models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**Dataset**

The dataset (bankruptcy.xlsx) contains financial attributes of companies, with labels indicating whether a company has gone bankrupt or not. The features include various financial ratios, such as liquidity, profitability, and leverage indicators.

**Results**

The trained model predicts bankruptcy probabilities based on historical financial data. Key insights and performance evaluation results are included in the notebook.
